        <h1>SonarQube (SQ)</h1>
        <p>
            SQ is a mature (2008) tool that uses pattern matching and dataflow
            analysis to analyze code and identify technical debt. It searches
            for code smells, bugs, security vulnerabilities. SQ provides linting
            capability for free, plus community & subscription editions of other
            services. An organisational model for full implementation of SQ is
            as follows: 
            Developers code in their IDEs and use SonarLint (see below) to run local analysis.
            Developers push their code into their favourite SCM : git, SVN, etc. 
            CI/CD server triggers automatic build, plus execution of the SonarScanner required to run
            the SonarQube analysis.
            Analysis report is sent to the SonarQube Server for processing. 5. SonarQube Server processes/stores analysis
            report results in SQ Database & displays results in UI/dashboard. 6.
            Developers review, comment, challenge issues to manage/reduce
            Technical Debt through the SonarQube UI. 7. Managers receive Reports
            from the analysis. Ops use APIs to automate configuration and
            extract data from SonarQube. Ops use JMX to monitor SonarQube
            Server.
        </p>
        <p>
            Community & free-trial license server editions are available here.
            Various scanners are provided to integrate with assorted build
            systems (Maven, Jenkins etc). Note that SonarSource analyzers do not
            run tests or generate coverage reports. They only import
            pre-generated reports. With JS jest-sonar-reporter or
            karma-sonarqube-unit-reporter are recommended, creating reports in
            the Generic Execution Data format. Both packages are available on
            npm.
        </p>
        <p>
            The JS-stack solution is SonarLint (open-source), integrated into
            multiple IDEs for developers (eg. in VS Code), plus into automated
            CI/CD pipelines via self-hosted SonarQube or on-line SonarCloud.
            SonarLint is an IDE extension that helps developers detect/fix
            quality issues. Like a spell checker, it squiggles flaws, so they
            can be fixed before committing code It currently encapsulates 220+
            rules which are essentially while-working Lint enhancements.
            Additional custom JS rules can be written in Java or into ESLint and
            imported.
        </p>
        <p>
            SQ claims to be standards-based; implicitly validating its rule-set,
            in-part perhaps for marketing purposes. This should be treated with
            at least a little scepticism...
        </p>
        <p>
            Criticism of SonarQube One 2020 study assessed the accuracy of SQ’s
            fault-prediction model and whether SQ violations are actually
            fault-prone by conducting an empirical study covering 21 mature
            open-source Java projects. Result: ‘violations classified as bugs by
            SonarQube hardly ever become a failure. Consequently, the accuracy
            of the fault-prediction power proposed by SonarQube is extremely
            low… rules applied by SonarQube for calculating technical debt
            should be thoroughly investigated, their harmfulness confirmed…
            companies should carefully consider which rules they really need to
            apply, especially if their goal is to reduce fault-proneness’.

            If you are still keen SonarLint download is available via the VS
            Code extensions left-tab, or from here. To run, it requires Node.js
            (version 8+), the Language support for Java VSCode extension
            (version 0.56.0+), plus Java Runtime (JRE) 8 or 11. The JRE path can
            be set explicitly via a sonarlint.ls.javaHome variable in VS Code
            settings.

            The service monitors as user types into JS, TS, Python, Java, HTML
            or PHP files. It immediately highlights/squiggles code classified as
            dubious, plus lists issues in the ‘Problems’ panel (terminal pane).
            The squiggles are distracting, though a context R-click does provide
            option to switch off assoc. rule. Unlike in, say, IntelliJ, there is
            no option for an immediate auto-fix. Detailed rule descriptions can
            be accessed directly via a contextual menu (clickable light-bulb).
        </p>
        <p>
            SonarLint can also link to SonarQube >= 6.7 or SonarCloud, binding
            workspace folders to a SonarQube/SonarCloud instance that inspects
            code server-side. This is a token-based service, configurable (via
            connection IDs) to bind to individual project folders.
        </p>
        <p>
            SonarLint keep server side data in a local storage. Changes to the
            quality profile etc. can update local storage via the command:
            "SonarLint: Update all project bindings to SonarQube/SonarCloud" (in
            command palette, search for "sonarlint").
